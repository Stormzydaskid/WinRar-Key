🔐 WinRAR Key (Educational Purposes Only) 🔐

This repository contains a WinRAR license key for educational purposes only. It is designed to show how license files are used to activate software without generating keys dynamically like a traditional keygen. 💻

💡 How It Works: To use the provided key, simply place the license file into the C:\Program Files\WinRAR directory. This will activate WinRAR as if you were using a legitimate license key. The repository demonstrates how key files can be used to bypass the trial version of software for educational purposes.

⚙️ Instructions:
1. Download the license file from this repository
2. Copy the file into C:\Program Files\WinRAR
3. Open WinRAR, and it should automatically be activated with the provided license

Please note: This is only for educational purposes and should not be used to bypass legitimate software licensing. 🙏
